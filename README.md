Developed a replica of the world-famous arcade game "Flappy Bird" using Pygame, a Python library for game
development.

In the game, the player's objective is to keep Faby airborne by pressing a key, causing it to flap its wings and
ascend. The player must navigate Faby through the gaps in the pipes without colliding with them. Each
successful pass through a gap earns the player a point, while collisions result in game over
